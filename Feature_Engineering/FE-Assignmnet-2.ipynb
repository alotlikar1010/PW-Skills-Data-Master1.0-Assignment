The interpolation factor is chosen randomly between 0 and 1, and the new instance is added to the dataset. SMOTE is an effective technique for handling imbalanced data, as it creates new synthetic instances that are similar to existing instances in the minority class, and can thus help the machine learning model generalize better to the minority class.

Precision is the fraction of true positive predictions among all positive predictions, while recall is the fraction of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances. F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. These metrics are useful when evaluating the performance of models on imbalanced datasets because they take into account both the false positive and false negative rates.\n",

A high AUC value suggests that the model is performing well on the dataset.\n",

    "2. **Synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE):** This method involves generating synthetic observations for the minority class to match the size of the majority class. SMOTE can be used in combination with random oversampling to balance the dataset. This can be done using techniques such as SMOTE from the imblearn library in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Adaptive synthetic sampling (ADASYN):** This method is similar to SMOTE but focuses on generating more synthetic observations for the minority class samples that are harder to learn. This can be done using techniques such as ADASYN from the imblearn library in Python."
